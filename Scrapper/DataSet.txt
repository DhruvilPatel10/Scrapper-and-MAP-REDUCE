Nielson graduated from Richfield, Utah High School in 1961.* He received his bachelor's degree in 1965 from the University of Utah and imeditately began teaching university courses in mathematics that very same year.  In 1970, he obtained a doctorate and that same year started his teaching and researching career at ASU. *BTW, the number 1961 is strobogrammatic which means that Prof. Nielson can wear his high school ring either way and the year reads correctly for both him and others! The next graduating class that can do this will be in the year 6009! (Possibly Prof. Nielson's Great^160 grandchild will wear such a ring!).
